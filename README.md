#### MielZoocloud Home page ####

**MielZoocloud** is a landing page built on top of **TailwindCSS** and coded in **React** / **Next.js**.

❤️ Visit our platform @ [MielZoo](https://mielzoo.cloud/).



## Usage

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Support notes

This template has been developed with the App Router (`app`) and React Server Components. If you’re unfamiliar with these beta features, you can find more information about them on the Next.js beta documentation page. So, please note that any request dealing with React (e.g. extra features, customisations, et cetera) is to be considered out of the support scope.
